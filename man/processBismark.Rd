processBismark(
  files = list.files(path = getwd(), pattern = "*.CpG_report.txt.gz"),
  meta = read.delim("sample_info.txt") \%>\% dplyr::mutate_if(is.character, as.factor),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{List of cytosine report file paths}

\item{meta}{Design matrix data frame with sample name in the Name column}

\item{testCovariate}{Factor of interest}

\item{adjustCovariate}{Variables to adjust for}

\item{matchCovariate}{Variable to block for when constructing permutations}

\item{coverage}{CpG coverage cutoff (1x recommended)}

\item{cores}{Integer specifying the number of cores to use}

\item{perGroup}{Percent of samples per a group to apply the CpG coverage cutoff to (from 0 to 1)}

\item{sexCheck}{Logical (TRUE or FALSE) indicating whether to confirm the sex of samples
and drop the sex chromosomes if both sexes are present.
This function requires a column called "Sex" (case sensitive) in sample_info.xlsx. 
Males should be coded as either "Male", "male", "M", or "m".
Females coded as "Female", "female", "F", or "f".}
